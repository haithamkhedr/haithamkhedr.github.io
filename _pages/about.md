# About me
<p class="font-monospace" >
  I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UMD. I'm working on security and safety of AI controlled systems in <a href="https://rcpsl.ece.umd.edu/home">Resilient Cyber-physical systems</a> group, and advised by Prof.<a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/~yshoukry/">Yasser Shoukry</a>. 

</p>
<p class="font-monospace">
  	My research interests are the safety and security of Machine learning algorithms and their applications to Autonomous Systems/Robotics. I'm also interested in Adversarial learning.
</p>

<p class="font-monospace">
	Before coming to UMD, I did my undergrad in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ain Shams University. During my studies, I had the opportunity to do a couple of internships. After that I worked in industry for two years in the automotive and traffic safety fields.
